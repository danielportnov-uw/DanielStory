Once upon a time there was a talented coder from the mythical land of Githubia. This coder, named Buckster, was always pushing the envelope in the field of computer science. One day, Buckster finally went too far and created an artificially intelligent machine capable of fully replicating a human being. 

On a stormy night with rain pounding on the roof of the cs building, Buckster was up late working on his artificial machine. After he entered the last line of code he hit the run buttonto test his creation. As he hit the green play button, lightning struck shaking the entire building causing the lights to disappear. 

After a short moment, the light in the building backs up. However, all his coding file in the computer goes missing. He is so frustrated that he stops coding and quit the job. He starts his own company called Boogle the Social Media.
